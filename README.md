## Check Language File

This is a utility program intended to be used to check the resource dictionary based language files used in the **Timthreetwelve** applications.

Files to be checked are expected to be xaml resource dictionaries with a `.xaml` file extention.

### Files are checked for:
- Duplicate keys (technically only the first duplicate key, since a duplicate key will throw an exception)
- Null or empty keys
- Null or empty values

### Nothing fancy:
❌ There's no installer, just a portable version in a zip file.

❌ No help or readme file.

❌ No dark theme or settings of any kind.

❌ English UI only.

### Requires .NET 6
