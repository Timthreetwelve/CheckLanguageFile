## Check Language File

This is a utility program intended to be used to validate the resource dictionary based language files used in the **Timthreetwelve** applications. The language files may also be compared to other language files to check for missing or deleted keys.

Files to be checked are expected to be xaml resource dictionaries with a `.xaml` file extension.

Files to be checked can be selected:
- By using the file open dialog (three dot button next to the boxes)
- By drag & drop into the appropriate textbox
- By copying and pasting

### In the File Validation tab, files are checked for:
- Syntax errors
- Duplicate keys (technically only the first duplicate key, since a duplicate key will throw an exception)
- Null or empty keys
- Null or empty values
  
Additionally, all keys and the associated string values are listed in a grid. The grid can be filtered by key or string.

### In the Compare Files tab:
- Two files are compared.
- Total number of keys are listed for each file.
- The grid at the bottom lists the values for each of the files. Missing values and values that are the same are color coded.
- üÜï The grid can be filtered to show only keys with no values or keys where the value is the same for both files.
- üÜï Both files can be added at the same time when using the file open dialog. Simply `Ctrl+Click` on two files.
- üÜï File names are displayed in the grid column headers.

### Nothing fancy:
‚ùå There's no installer, just a portable version in a zip file.

‚ùå No help or readme file.

‚ùå No dark theme or settings of any kind.

‚ùå English UI only.

‚ùå No logging.

### Requires .NET 6
